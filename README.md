# Project Access Token Refresh

This project is aimed at implementing access token refresh functionality using a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js Express application, with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

## Overview

In many applications, JWTs are used for authentication and authorization. JWTs have an expiration time, after which they become invalid. To ensure uninterrupted user sessions, it is important to implement a mechanism to refresh the access token before it expires.

This project demonstrates how to implement an access token refresh functionality using a client-side React application and a server-side Node.js Express application. The client application will handle token refresh and seamlessly update the access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your development machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).


## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Aashish-Kaushik/token-auth-app.git
   ```

2. Install server-side dependencies:
   ```
   cd token-auth/server
   npm install
   ```

3. Install client-side dependencies:
   ```
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```

5. Start the client:
   ```
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The client-side application is responsible for making API requests to the server. When a user logs in or performs an action that requires an authenticated request, the client application should include the access token in the request headers.

If the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code, it means the access token has expired. In this case, the client application should send a refresh token to the server to obtain a new access token.

The server-side application should implement a route to handle the token refresh request. It should validate the refresh token, generate a new access token, and return it to the client. The client application should update the access token in its state or storage and retry the failed request with the new token.

Make sure to properly handle token storage, expiration times, and secure transmission between the client and server. This project provides a basic implementation, but you should consider security best practices when implementing token-based authentication in a production environment.
